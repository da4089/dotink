This post started out as a long-form response to this tweet by Raj Kunkolienkar:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Question to all the side project machines that I follow (with much respect) : what framework / setup / infrastructure / tools do you use to push out ideas to MVP so quickly?<a href="https://twitter.com/kognise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kognise</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thesephist</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jajoosam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jajoosam</a></p>&mdash; Raj Kunkolienkar ðŸš€ (@kunksed) <a href="https://twitter.com/kunksed/status/1130681972794175490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2019</a></blockquote>

... but then, I got busy, a few weeks passed, and it took a while for me to get back to it. On the upside, I have a new place for my ramblings now, which is [dotink.co](https://dotink.co). It's meant to be a more technical blog for when I want to talk more about software and design, but we'll see how things go.

## Side projects

Over the last year, it seems like I've developed a habit of working on and releasing a large number of side projects, from the mundane (like [the blocks.css library](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/)) to the interesting (like [Sounds from Places](https://soundsfromplaces.surge.sh)) to the technical (like [making a new programming language](https://github.com/thesephist/ink)). Everybody's process and working style is different, but I thought it may be interesting to share how I think about side projects, and go from question to idea to execution to promotion.
