I think modern libraries can improve in two ways.

First, the libraries around neighborhoods that need the most great libraries also struggle the most building well-designed, educational communal spaces. I think there's a lot of room here to use economics to create equity. Second, I think even the best libraries focus on getting people there, not necessary on being well designed communal spaces that integrate and bring value to the rest of the community who aren't there day in and day out.
