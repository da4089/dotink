It was the kind of good that lingers in your mind, but I'm still afraid that the moment I stop paying attention, it'll slip away, like a good dream rudely interrupted by the sun shining through the curtains. There's a feeling here that I never want to lose, a fuel that could keep me going, if only I could keep from letting it slip through my fingers.

So I'm sitting here, late-night hotel room coffee in hand, trying to tell the story of this year's XOXO to my future self, who'll inevitably need a reminder once in a while about how great it can be to meet other people who care so deeply about such diverse and beautiful things, about creating art that speaks truthfully, and about each other.

This is a story about XOXO, a real-world manifestation of the most quietly vibrant, inspiring online communities I know, one that gave mea  weekend that was good -- the kind of good that's hard to put into words, because the moment I pick one out, I'm afraid it won't capture quite the fuzzy feelings I hold so dearly tonight.

## What exactly is this event, some kind of festival?

// what it is
// who was there
// meatspace of a cyberspace

## To tell a good story

// xoxo is about stories. etc.
XOXO is about stories.

These stores are about people.

These stories are about places. The chinook tribe reservation

They're about things. The podcast. The music earworm.

## A life lends a voice, a voice lends a story

A good life is one that builds a good story in this sense --(?) honest, authentic, one with a belief that's unique, one that is resilient.

// Thank you to Andys, speakers, people I met, and attendees for the memorable weekend.
