Inputs: how you spend your time, how you prioritize, what info you take in and who you meet.

Output: consequences, grades, achievements.

There's, like, three critical resources you have as a person that's extremely limited and non-renewable:

1. Who you choose to be around
2. What you spend your time doing
3. What you choose to keep on your mind

...in rough order of importance.

I feel like in focusing on long-term goals and consequences, it's all too easy to teach people to carelessly and recklessly allocate how they spend these three resources. but I think as long as you thoughtfully allocate these 3, the outcomes take care of themselves.
