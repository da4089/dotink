As of today, I'm twenty-one years old, an arbitrary number that's only slightly less arbitrary in the US. I've talked for pages and pages about what I've learned in all of the years leading up to today, so today, I wanted to take a few pages to share what I still _don't know_. Over time, hopefully, I'll be able to check off this list one by one. The best I can do now is to slowly chip away at these big questions.

## Things I don't know about myself

1. My Korean-American Identity

2. What kind of work I want to do in the medium-term (technical, leadership)

3. What I want to spend the rest of my college career studying (switching majors). I already think to solve problems all day and night, mostly technical and operational. I want to think to understand, and phil/English/rhetoric gives me that catharsis. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to do things without really thinking much about why I want to do things.

4. What kind of place I want to live in

5. How to motivate myself to do things I don't enjoy

6. How to feed myself properly

7. How to dress nicely

## Things I don't know about the world

8. How to speak Mandarin

9. How to invest (in startups, and in the broader market)

10. How to read people

11. How to travel easily across borders

12. How to counteract climate change

13. How to improve how the world learns

14. How to equally distribute opportunity

## Things I don't know about my work

15. How to build inter-organizational relationships

16. How to manage people

17. How to work part-time, productively

18. How to balance work and life

19. How to use deep learning

20. How to use Docker

## The big question

21. Why do I do the work I do? Who for? What for? When do I stop?
