Good software engineering is concerned with two kinds of scale: operational scale, and engineering scale.

Scalable software grows gracefully under scale; scale-free software accomodates scale by not needing to scale.

We should strive to make most of our software like bricks, and only a small subset like houses.

- small, composable interfaces
- portable platforms
- encapsulated units
- design constraints and specialization
