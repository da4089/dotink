Every year, I set [a few goals for myself](https://medium.com/@thesephist/my-goals-for-2019-b1d5e93431ac). This year, the list included one particular goal that I want to share. I'm on track to check it off before 2020, and more than any of the others, working towards meeting this one goal has completely changed how I live and work. Here's how I described it in my journal on January 1, 2019.

>Meet with at least 150 new and interesting people. These can't just be passing hellos -- try to have meaningful conversations that go beyond the meeting, and hopefully lead to relationships that last.

There's a bit of grey area here around what counts as a "meeting with" a person, rather than, say, a coincidental hello. But my general practice has been to count any conversations where I've learned something new, where I've found something memorable about the person, or something that's led to a longer-term, lasting relationship. After the first time I met someone, I'd jot down their name, how I found them, what we talked about, and what I remember about them and what they wanted to do. As I head into September, my list is 110 such entries long.

## People matter

// people filter your information ingestion

// you become like the people that you surround yourself with

## "Networking"

// is it unethical to network for the sake of networking? Is networking inherently self-serving? Why does it have bad connotation? Why do I think it's good?

// If you want to network in a way that helps you long-term, you need to give, without expecting returns. My list is a way for me to do that (help) more effectively than I can without it.

// Networking events.... aren't really useful, because the people doing cool stuff are out there doing cool stuff. I think ultimately there's only one kind of valuable relationship, and it's not what "networkers" call networking.

## Hit or miss

// you don't have to like everyone. It's about finding friends, not making friends.

// how do you keep in contact after the initial meeting?

## Opening deeper conversations

// the best conversations aren't about classes or work. they're about what people care about and what they want to do with their energy.

## Never Eat Alone

Keith Ferrazzi's _Never Eat Alone_ was the first book I ever read that you could consider in the realm of "business" or "management".

Have strong opinions, but know where you shouldn't. Work on something that you genuinely find worthwhile, and talk about it like it matters. Learn to tell good stories. Be curious about people, because even if you can do it all alone, it's so much better with other people.

// - From Hack Club's Yousef: How I think about meeting interesting people in college, merits of cities / prestigious colleges versus the lack thereof. Present my concentration and ideal gas theory-based hypothesis for understanding people and communities. Yousef fundamentally suggested "How to meet interesting people in tech." I think I can spin that into 1. my understanding of difference between e.g. Berk/Stanford vs Purdue, and 2. model of different cities, their values, and concentrations of people.
