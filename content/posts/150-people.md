Every year, I set [a few goals for myself](https://medium.com/@thesephist/my-goals-for-2019-b1d5e93431ac). This year, the list included one particular goal that I want to share. I'm on track to check it off before 2020, and more than any of the others, working towards meeting this one goal has changed how I live and work. Here's how I described it in my journal on January 1, 2019.

>Meet with at least 150 new and interesting people. These can't just be passing hellos -- try to have meaningful conversations that go beyond the meeting, and hopefully lead to relationships that last.

There's a bit of grey area here around what counts as a "meeting with" a person, rather than, say, a coincidental hello. But my general practice has been to count any conversations where I've learned something new, where I've found something memorable about the person, or something that's led to a longer-term, lasting relationship. After the first time I met someone, I'd jot down their name, how I found them, what we talked about, and what I remember about them and what they wanted to do. As of the end of August 2019, my list is 102 such entries long.

## Hit or miss

## Opening deeper conversations

## Never Eat Alone

Keith Ferrazzi's _Never Eat Alone_ was the first book I ever read that you could call "business" or "managementy".

Have strong opinions, but know where you shouldn't. Work on something that you genuinely find worthwhile, and talk about it like it matters. Learn to tell stories. Be curious about people, because even if you can do it all alone, it's so much better with them.
