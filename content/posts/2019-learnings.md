At the beginning of the year, I made a few bets and set a few goals that ended up having an outsized positive impact in my life for the last twelve months. These bets and investments improved how I work, where I work, and with whom; how I think about my time and life, and what I learned this year. I want to share a few today, so as you look forward to the next year and decade, some of these ideas may be helpful in your planning.

## Bet on people doing exciting things

// 150 people

## Bet on opportunities that move you

// take opportunities as thye come, if they speak to you. Minimize regret. See dots connect later.

## Bet on sharing what you have to tell the world

// writing. HN. twitter.

## Bet on communities that inspire you

// medium: community, not capital
