Hi there, I'm Linus. I usually go by [@thesephist](https://twitter.com/thesephist).

Welcome to...

# The Ink blog

This is my technical blog, and it's named after a programming language I created called Ink, a functional language that takes after modern JavaScript and Go. This website is served by a [server written in Ink](https://github.com/thesephist/dotink/blob/master/src/fileserver.ink). [Read more about Ink here.](https://linus.zone/ink)

I write here about programming languages, interpreters and compilers, frameworks, web applications, software architecture, observability and operations, and other things. You can [read them here](/posts/).

If you want to see other stuff I'm up to, you can find me on the internet in the usual places at @thesephist.
