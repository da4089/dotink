Hi there,

I'm Linus.

I usually go by [@thesephist](https://twitter.com/thesephist).

# This is my blog

about software and design. It's named after a programming language I created called Ink, a functional language that takes after modern JavaScript and Go. This website is served by a [server written in Ink](https://github.com/thesephist/dotink/blob/master/src/fileserver.ink). [Read more about Ink here.](https://linus.zone/ink)

## These are my posts

on programming languages, interpreters and compilers, frameworks, web applications, software architecture, observability and operations, and other things. You can [read them here](/posts/).

## I work on infrastructure,

from the ones made from bits and bytes running the internet to the ones made from people and ideas that help everyone,

everyone,

_everyone_

channel their creativity and perspective to improve how we live.

If you're working on an idea to help everyone build things, or making something cool yourself, let's talk.

You can find me on the internet in the usual places at @thesephist.
