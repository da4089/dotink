# The Ink blog

This is my technical blog, and it's named after a programming language I created called Ink, a functional language that takes after modern JavaScript and Go. I use Ink to do most of my day-to-day [scripting](https://thesephist.com/posts/blog-analysis/) and build some of my core apps with it. This website is served by a [server written in Ink](https://github.com/thesephist/dotink/blob/master/src/fileserver.ink). [Read more about Ink here.](https://linus.zone/ink)

I write here on this blog about programming languages, interpreters and compilers, frameworks, web applications, software architecture, observability and operations, and other things. You can [read them here](/posts/). This website is also home to the [Ink programming language documentation](/docs/), which is a work in progress.

If you want to see other stuff I'm up to, you can find more on my website at [thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com) and on Twitter at [@thesephist](https://twitter.com/thesephist).
