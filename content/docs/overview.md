## What's Ink?

Ink is a functional, general-purpose, interpreted scripting language.

// like the first chapter of Awk

## Quick start

### Setup and installation

Ink is distributed as a static executable binary, and you can download it from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/thesephist/ink/releases). We current build release versions of Ink for Linux, macOS, Windows, and OpenBSD.

### The repl

### Writing and running programs

## Security and permissions model

One of Ink's more interesting features is that we can run an Ink program and selectively restrict the running program's permissions.
