                <h2>Thank you Repl.it, Hello Hack Club</h2>
                <p>Summer&rsquo;s almost over! It&rsquo;s a change of season, and the season of changes.
My internship at Repl.it is coming to a close, and I&rsquo;m joining the fantastic team at Hack Club moving forward. I wanted to take a moment to talk about what I learned at Repl.it, and why I&rsquo;m so excited about Hack Club.
Repl.it: building for builders Today was my last day as an engineering intern at Repl.</p>

                <h2>Visualizing and exploring sorting algorithms in two dimensions with Ink</h2>
                <p>Until Elon Musk brings his Neuralink gadgets to market, our eyes are the highest-bandwidth way we have of understanding the world around us. We can look at something and immediately take in the hues, the lightness and the darkness, the shapes, and most importantly, the patterns that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to notice if we couldn&rsquo;t use our vision.
In fact, our eyes are surprisingly good at pattern recognition, noticing the rhythm in the details that make up the large-scale structure of what&rsquo;s in front of us.</p>

                <h2>How I side project</h2>
                <p>This post started out as a long-form response to this tweet by Raj Kunkolienkar:
Question to all the side project machines that I follow (with much respect) : what framework / setup / infrastructure / tools do you use to push out ideas to MVP so quickly?@kognise @thesephist @jajoosam
