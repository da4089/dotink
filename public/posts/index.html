                <h2>inkfmt: a self-hosting code formatter for Ink</h2>
                <p>inkfmt (pronounced &ldquo;ink format&rdquo; or sometimes &ldquo;ink fuh-mt&rdquo;) is a self-hosting code formatter for the Ink language. This means inkfmt takes valid Ink programs and normalizes the formatting of the code to be readable and clean.</p>

                <h2>How I set up my servers</h2>
                <p>Many of my projects include a web server, usually written in Go, Node.js, or Ink. I deploy these servers to Linux VMs running on DigitalOcean, and I set them all up very similarly. I currently have 17 separate web servers / projects running across two $5/month servers.</p>

                <h2>Computing pi as a Riemann sum</h2>
                <p>While researching the difference between Intel&rsquo;s various x86 SIMD extensions, I came across this article that demonstrates SSE and AVX performance differences using an algorithm to compute an approximation of pi using a Riemann sum under a curve.</p>

                <p>(This is an archived copy of a post originally published at thesephist.com.)
As I&rsquo;m diving deeper into my role at Hack Club Bank, I&rsquo;m trying to learn more about sales and working with customers, and I&rsquo;m also learning a lot every week about leading a B2B product.</p>

Summer&rsquo;s almost over! It&rsquo;s a change of season, and the season of changes.
My internship at Repl.it is coming to a close, and I&rsquo;m joining the fantastic team at Hack Club moving forward.</p>

                <h2>Visualizing and exploring sorting algorithms in two dimensions with Ink</h2>
                <p>Until Elon Musk brings his Neuralink gadgets to market, our eyes are the highest-bandwidth way we have of understanding the world around us. We can look at something and immediately take in the hues, the lightness and the darkness, the shapes, and most importantly, the patterns that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to notice if we couldn&rsquo;t use our vision.</p>

This post started out as a long-form response to this tweet by Raj Kunkolienkar:
Question to all the side project machines that I follow (with much respect) : what framework / setup / infrastructure / tools do you use to push out ideas to MVP so quickly?</p>
