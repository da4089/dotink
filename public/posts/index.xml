      <description>inkfmt (pronounced &amp;ldquo;ink format&amp;rdquo; or sometimes &amp;ldquo;ink fuh-mt&amp;rdquo;) is a self-hosting code formatter for the Ink language. This means inkfmt takes valid Ink programs and normalizes the formatting of the code to be readable and clean. inkfmt is itself an Ink program, and inkfmt uses itself to format its own source code.</description>

      <description>While researching the difference between Intel&amp;rsquo;s various x86 SIMD extensions, I came across this article that demonstrates SSE and AVX performance differences using an algorithm to compute an approximation of pi using a Riemann sum under a curve.</description>
