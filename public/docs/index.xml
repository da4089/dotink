      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Ink? Ink is a functional, general-purpose, interpreted scripting language. It&amp;rsquo;s dynamically and strongly typed. Ink programs can be web servers, short scripts, drawing programs, or anything else that interfaces with files and networks. Ink is designed to be minimal and simple, first and foremost.
I made Ink as an experiment to study writing interpreters and compilers in mid-2019. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on several other related projects in the programming language space, but continue to write programs and apps in Ink in my day to day work.</description>

Ink programs are UTF-8 or ASCII text files with the .ink file extension. Ink&amp;rsquo;s syntax takes inspiration from Go and modern JavaScript, and strives to be minimal, concise, unambiguous, and fast to parse.
Comments Ink, like C, has both single- and multi-line comments.
Keywords Commas and automatic comma insertion Grouping Whitespace and indentation Variables and assignment Ink identifiers can start with any alphabetic character and can contain any alphanumeric character.</description>

      <description>Primitive Types Ink has four primitive types:
   The composite interface Ink&amp;rsquo;s string and composite (and there for list) data types both follow the same interface for composite data types. This means that any functions buit around the interface will be correct for strings (including arbitrary blob data), composite dictionaries, and lists. The coposite interface consists of the following operations and functions. Say we have a composite c with string key k.</description>
